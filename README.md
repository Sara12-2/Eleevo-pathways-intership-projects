# 🏦 Loan Approval Prediction (with SMOTE)

This project builds a machine learning pipeline to predict loan approval decisions based on applicant data. It addresses class imbalance using SMOTE and compares the performance of Logistic Regression and Decision Tree classifiers.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Financial institutions need reliable systems to assess loan applications. This project aims to predict whether a loan should be **approved (`1`)** or **rejected (`0`)** using features such as income, credit history, and education.

---

## 📦 Dataset

- **Source**: Simulated or anonymized loan application data  
- **Target Variable**: `Loan_Status` (0 = Rejected, 1 = Approved)  
- **Features Used**:
  - `ApplicantIncome`
  - `LoanAmount`
  - `Credit_History`
  - `Education`
  - `Gender`
  - `Married`
  - *(Additional features if available)*

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python 🐍  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- ipywidgets (for interactive GUI)

---

## 📈 Workflow

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values
- Encoded categorical variables
- Scaled numerical features
- Split into training and test sets

### 2. Modeling
- Trained two classifiers:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
- Applied **SMOTE** to balance training data

### 3. Evaluation
- Confusion Matrix
- Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Accuracy and class-wise metrics

### 4. Bonus: Interactive GUI

## 📊 Results

| Model                  | Accuracy | F1-Score (Approved) |
|-----------------------|----------|---------------------|
| Logistic Regression   | 91.3%    | 0.931               |
| Decision Tree         | 98.4%    | 0.987               |
| Logistic + SMOTE      | 92.3%    | 0.937               |
| Decision Tree + SMOTE | 98.0%    | 0.984               |

- **SMOTE** improved recall for minority class (rejected loans)

- Drop rows with missing values  

### 2. Feature Selection  
- **Features**: `Year`, `Month`, `Week`, `Lag_1`, `Lag_2`
